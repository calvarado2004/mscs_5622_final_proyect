# Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical metric for any business. It's much more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, so it's important to be able to predict which customers are likely to churn. This allows the business to take proactive steps to retain those customers, such as offering them special deals or discounts.

In this project, we will use machine learning to predict customer churn. We will train several different models on a dataset of customer interactions, and evaluate their performance using a test dataset. We will also explore the data to identify any patterns or relationships that might help us to understand why customers churn.

## Data

The dataset contains information about customer interactions with a services company. The data includes the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for
- **Age**: The age of the customer
- **Tenure**: The length of time that the customer has been with
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer
- **Subscription Type**: The type of subscription that the customer has ("Basic", "Standard", "Premium")
- **Last Interaction**: The date of the customer's last interaction with the company
- **Total Spend**: The total amount of money that the customer has spent
- **Payment Delay**: The number of days that the customer's payment is delayed
- **Support Calls**: The number of support calls that the customer has made
- **Usage Frequency**: The frequency with which the customer uses the service
- **Contract Length**: The length of the customer's contract ("Monthly", "Quarterly", "Yearly")
- **Churn**: Whether the customer has churned ("Yes" or "No")

## Dataset Source 

We used Kaggle to get the dataset, you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset/data)

## Approach

We will start by loading the data and exploring it to understand the features and the target variable. Then we will preprocess the data and train several different models on it. We will evaluate the performance of the models using a test dataset, and explore the data to identify any patterns or relationships that might help us to understand why customers churn.
